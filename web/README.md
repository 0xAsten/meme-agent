# Meme Agent: AI-Powered Meme NFT Generation Platform

## Problem Statement

The current landscape of meme creation and distribution faces several challenges:

1. **Creativity Barrier**: Creating engaging memes requires both humor and graphic design skills that not everyone possesses.
2. **Ownership Issues**: In the digital space, meme creators rarely receive credit or compensation for their work.
3. **Distribution Limitations**: Even great memes struggle to reach their potential audience without proper distribution channels.
4. **Monetization Challenges**: Digital content creators have limited options to monetize meme creation.
5. **Fragmented Workflow**: Current meme creation involves multiple tools and platforms, making the process cumbersome.
